# Fine-Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow

## In this [project](https://www.coursera.org/projects/fine-tune-bert-tensorflow/), you will learn how to fine-tune a BERT model for text classification using TensorFlow and TF-Hub.

### The pretrained BERT model used in this project is [available](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/2) on [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/).

```bash 
!git clone --depth 1 -b v2.3.0 https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
```
pip install -Uqr models/official/requirements.txt
